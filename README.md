# WeatherForecastingUsingRNN
Weather forecasting and prediction involves formulating and disseminating in- formation about future weather conditions based upon the collection and anal- ysis of meteorological observations.

Problem Statement:
To predict the weather temperature using time series data and various attributes like– Temper- ature, Wind speed, precipitation and humidity etc.

Methodology:
I have used the LSTM Model which is a type of RNN to preditct the weather temperature. Since Weather data is time series in nature, LSTM would be a good fit to model this data. LSTM stands for long short-term memory networks, used in the field of Deep Learning. It is a
variety of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are capable of learning long-term dependencies, especially in sequence prediction problems. Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) is a type of Neural Network where the output from the previous step are fed as input to the current step. In traditional neural networks, all the inputs and outputs are independent of each other, but in cases like when it is required to predict the next word of a sentence, the previous words are required and hence there is a need to remember the previous words. Thus RNN came into existence, which solved this issue with the help of a Hidden Layer.

My Aim is to process data with periodic patterns in it, such as predicting the weather temper- ature.A good strategy is to look back at the temperature of the previous day. So, you need to know what data needs to be forgotten and what needs to be stored for later reference. Else, you need to have a really good memory. Recurrent neural networks seem to be doing a good job at this, theoretically. However, they have two downsides, exploding gradient and vanishing gradient, that make them redundant.
Here, LSTM introduces memory units, called cell states, to solve this problem. The designed cells may be seen as differentiable memory.

Results/Discussion:
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is well- suited for modeling sequential data, such as time series data. This makes LSTM a suitable choice for weather prediction, as weather patterns are inherently sequential in nature.
In weather prediction, LSTMs can be used to model the temporal dynamics of weather variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. LSTMs can also be used to analyze large amounts of historical weather data to make predictions about future weather patterns.
In this model, I am  trying to predict the temperature based on the past three hours of weather conditions. The data set consists of 12 variables with more than 90000 observations.Temperature and weather features, such as precipitation and cloud cover, are closely related. For example, when there is a high amount of cloud cover, the temperature will generally be cooler than when there is little or no cloud cover. Similarly, when it is raining or snowing, the temperature will typically be lower than when it is not. Additionally, the temperature can also be affected by wind, with stronger winds generally making it feel cooler than when there is no wind. Overall, the temperature is strongly correlated with many different weather features, and understanding these relationships can help to make more accurate weather predictions.

Model Summary:
The LSTM model is able to remember previous information and use it to make more accurate predictions. It can also handle missing data and long-term dependencies in the input data. Train- ing the LSTM model involves feeding it a dataset of historical temperature data and adjusting the model’s parameters to minimize the difference between the predicted temperatures and the actual temperatures. Once trained, the model can be used to make predictions about future temperatures. In the model, we have 12873 parameters in total and all the parameters are trainable. It’s a fully connected LSTM model with 7936 fully connected parameters.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks are a powerful tool for weather pre- diction, particularly for time series data like temperature prediction. LSTMs are able to handle sequential data and maintain a "memory" of past observations, which allows them to better capture temporal dependencies in the data. To make a temperature prediction using LSTM, historical temperature data is needed, which can be obtained from weather stations or other sources. The data then needs to be cleaned and preprocessed to make it suitable for input into the LSTM. The data would be split into training and testing datasets. Next, an LSTM model is trained on the training data, and then used to make predictions on the test data.
It’s worth nothing that temperature prediction has many nuances and factors that can affect it, such as synoptic patterns, seasonality, and location. Therefore, it may be necessary to include other features besides time series temperature data and use more complex models like ensemble models or use more sophisticated techniques like hybrid models to achieve better predictions.
In general, making weather predictions is a challenging task due to the complexity of the natural systems and the many factors that can affect weather. LSTM models are a powerful tool that can be used to make weather predictions, but it is important to consider the specific use case, the available data, and the resources when choosing the best approach for making weather predictions.
However, it’s important to note that weather prediction is a complex task and LSTM is just one of the tools that can be used to improve prediction accuracy. Other factors such as the quality and availability of data, the specific weather variables being modeled, and the spatial and temporal scale of the prediction also play a key role.
